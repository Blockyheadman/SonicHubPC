## Welcome
Welcome to Sonic Hub PC!
Sonic Hub PC is a PC version of the online version of Sonic Hub made by Blockyheadman (me)
I'm deciding to make it on PC so it's gives a better experience for PC users! (and maybe even mobile!)

## Features
* Buttons that lead to online game links
* Settings
* Sound effects
* Changelog
* Animations
* Music

## Available Platforms
Currently the list of supported platforms is small but may increase over time:
* Windows
* MacOS (NEW!!)
* Linux/X11

## My Goal
My goal with this project is to learn more about making UI with godot and making it functional. It's also to provide a better experience for PC users using Sonic Hub.

## Project Note:
After some time and consideration, I made some updates to Sonic Hub PC and I'm finally going to announce that the project will go open source! You will be able to modify it and make as many changes as you want! However, I'm going to be retiring this project and making it an archive. Thank you so much to everyone who liked it! I'll see you next project!
